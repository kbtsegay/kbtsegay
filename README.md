### Welcome to my Github 🤙🏾

Hi, my name is Kaleb. I am an MS candidate studying Computer Science/AI 👨🏿‍💻 at Stanford. I also received my BS with honors in Biology  🧬 from Stanford just last year. I am planning to graduate with my masters at the end of this fall 2023.

I am also a research scientist 🧑🏿‍🔬🧫🔬 the Haileselassie Lab at Stanford Med in the Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care Medicine. My research interests include mitochondrial dynamics and mitoDAMPs in inflammatory disease. 

Aside from my basic science approaches, I am exploring the idea of using a transcriptomics based approach to analyzing the release of extracellular mitochondria and their impact on inflammatory signaling. I am also exploring the role of mtDNA deletions on GVHD onset and am actually building a clinically-relevant GVHD predictor which you can follow here on my Github. 

I’m obsessed with ML applications in immunology and the intersection of NLP and medicine.
